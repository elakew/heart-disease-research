# Heart Disease Research

In this project, I reviewed and analyzed data from a sample of patients evaluated for heart disease at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The data was downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). We will study a number of **quantitative, binary, and categorical variables**, produce **boxplots**, and employ **hypothesis testing** to better understand the relationships between the variables.

Focus Areas for Analysis
Determine whether there is an association between people with heart disease and another healther indicator such as high cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and maximum heart rate.
Utilize hypothesis testing - namely one-sample t-test, binomial test, two-sample t-test, ANOVA test, Tukey's range test, and chi-square test - to draw inferences about a population from the sample of data.

The following Python packages were utilized:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Statsmodels

Variables in Dataset
- age: age in years
- sex: sex assigned at birth; 'male' or 'female'
- trestbps: resting blood pressure in mm Hg
- chol: serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- cp: chest pain type ('typical angina', 'atypical angina', 'non-anginal pain', or 'asymptomatic')
- exang: whether the patient experiences exercise-induced angina (1: yes; 0: no)
- fbs: whether the patientâ€™s fasting blood sugar is >120 mg/dl (1: yes; 0: no)
- thalach: maximum heart rate achieved in exercise test
- heart_disease: whether the patient is found to have heart disease ('presence': diagnosed with heart disease; 'absence': no heart disease)
