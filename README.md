# Heart Disease Research

In this project, I reviewed and analyzed data from a sample of patients evaluated for heart disease at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The data was downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). We will study a number of **quantitative, binary, and categorical variables**, produce **boxplots**, and utilize **hypothesis testing** to better understand the relationships between the variables. This project was completed in the *Master Statistics with Python* skill path on Codecademy.

The following Python packages were utilized:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Statsmodels
