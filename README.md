# Heart Disease Research

In this project, I reviewed and analyzed data from a sample of patients evaluated for heart disease at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The data was downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). We will study a number of **quantitative, binary, and categorical variables**, produce **boxplots**, and employ **hypothesis testing** to better understand the relationships between the variables.

The following Python packages were utilized:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Statsmodels

Variables in Dataset
- age: age in years
- sex: sex assigned at birth; 'male' or 'female'
- trestbps: resting blood pressure in mm Hg
- chol: serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- cp: chest pain type ('typical angina', 'atypical angina', 'non-anginal pain', or 'asymptomatic')
- exang: whether the patient experiences exercise-induced angina (1: yes; 0: no)
- fbs: whether the patientâ€™s fasting blood sugar is >120 mg/dl (1: yes; 0: no)
- thalach: maximum heart rate achieved in exercise test
- heart_disease: whether the patient is found to have heart disease ('presence': diagnosed with heart disease; 'absence': no heart disease)
